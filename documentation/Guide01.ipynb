    "This guide explains how to obtain SpatialIDs within a certain distance of a given line. We'll review the following functions:\n",

    "\n",
    "As explained [here](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb), the `%%` shortcut is a feature of GoNB. It wraps subsequent code in a main() function that allows for things like a `fmt.Print()` call. If you're copying the code into a standard `.go` file, please exclude `%%`."
